g3pylib is a python wrapper around the Glasses3 web API which lets you control Glasses3 devices.

## API Endpoints
All endpoints in the `g3pylib` module corresponding to an endpoint in the Glasses3 web API are undocumented and placed first in each module.
The following naming convention is used to translate web API endpoint names to `g3pylib
` API endpoint names:
 - Properties: example_property -> get_example_property/set_example_property
 - Actions: example_action -> example_action
 - Signals: example_signal -> subscribe_to_example_signal

The web API endpoints can be browsed in the Glasses3 Example web client accessed via http://*your-g3-address*.

## Useful information
In any code examples, `g3` will be a connected instance of `Glasses3`.

The default hostname of a Glasses3 device is its serial number.
